SiSwati, or Swazi, is a Bantu language spoken by 4.7 million people in Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, and South Africa, as a first or second language.
It is one of the African languages that are under-represented as far as NLP research is concerned. That necessitate this project. With it, we are building resources that can be used for research.
We propose three works:
  a. Siswati sentiment analysis dataset
  b. Python library for cleaning siSwati text
  c. Cleaning datasets for stopwords, slang words, typos, and borrowed words.
